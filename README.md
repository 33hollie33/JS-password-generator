# Challenges within this course

This challenge presented with HTML and CSS which was completed. Therefore no changes were made to the orignal HTML and CSS. There was minimal Javascript code provided and used as a guide. Therefore, there is no comments made to the CSS and HTML, just comments to the Javascript to guide other developers on how the task was completed. In the Javascript code,the code that was had been provided has been highlighted within the comments. The main task was to generate a password that enabled employees to have a criteria that they create themselves. The user wanted have access to senistive data using a safe and random genrated password with the criteria that they have asked for themselves. When the user wants to change their password they are presented woth a series of prompts for a password criteria. This highlights the interactivity that Javascript provides for users. 

The password has certain criterias in which the user could choose for example: uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. I used the oswap tool to guide in which special chracters should be included. Link here: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters. In addition to this, the other criteria for the generated password were the length of password should have a minimum of 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. Once the user has chosen a criteria, they click an application 'Generate Password'. This is when they should be presented with a password that fits the criteria they have requested. 

Issues within the Javascript and how it was solved:
1. Firstly, I created variables for the password. Variables can store primitaive data types. For this, I specifically used a string variable. The variable consisted of: uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters. I completed this by using the 'const' tag.

2. To enable the password to be generated a function tag was created to enable the password to be generated. The function tga within Javascript enables the piece of code that has been written to be re-used over and over again. This keeps the code clean and conscise and easier to read for other developers. The console
